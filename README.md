# Project Overview

This platform is an **integrated Capstone Repository and Academic Roles Portal**, enabling students to publish ongoing or completed capstone projects that showcase their research focus, methods, and skills. 

Faculty, researchers, and external professionals can discover these projects and participate in structured roles such as **collaborators, evaluators, or data contributors**. 

By connecting student work with real-world academic engagement, the platform improves **transparency, stakeholder discovery, and the overall quality and impact** of student research.
